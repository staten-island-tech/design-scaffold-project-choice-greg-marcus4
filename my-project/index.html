            The Louvre, often known as the Louvre Museum, is a historic monument
            in Paris, France, and the world's most visited museum. It houses
            some of the world's most famous works of art, like as the Mona Lisa
            and the Venus de Milo. It is located on the Right Bank of the Seine
            in the city's 1st arrondissement and is a civic landmark (district
            or ward). Approximately 38,000 pieces from prehistory to the
            twenty-first century are on display at any given moment, covering an
            area of 72,735 square meters (782,910 square feet).The museum is
            housed in the Louvre Palace, which was erected by Philip II in the
            late 12th and early 13th centuries. In the museum's basement,
            remnants of the medieval Louvre fortress can be seen. The stronghold
            soon lost its defensive function as a result of urban expansion, and
            Francis I converted it into the French Kings' royal home in 1546.
            [6] The current Louvre Palace was built after the structure was
            enlarged several times. Louis XIV chose the Palace of Versailles for
            his household in 1682, leaving the Louvre primarily as a display
            space for the royal collection, which included ancient Greek and
            Roman sculpture from 1692.

          Railroads in France have been used since 1827. They have been used for
          many various purposes, such as transporting goods, transporting
          soldiers, and helping people get around. The network has undergone a
          major modernization since 1981 with the arrival of the TGV high-speed
          rail service which has been consistently expanded in following years.
          They can go up to 300 km/h (186 mph) and are the pride of France's
          railway technology. It is currently the second largest European
          railway network, with a total of 29,901 kilometers of railway, and
          more being added each day.

          The beautiful, natural, and man-made waterways of France are the
          largest in the entire continent of Europe. They expand through 8,500
          kilometers (5,300 miles) of France and are mostly managed by the
          French navigation authority. Such examples would include the Loire,
          Seine and Rhône. Tourists are able to cruise through many of them to
